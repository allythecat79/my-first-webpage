    <h1>My knitting blog!</h1>

    <h2>These are the very basics of my experience in knitting.</h2>

    <h3>Yarn</h3>
    <p>First you need yarn.  A lot of people start with a washcloth as their first project.  For a washcloth you need an inexpensive cotton yarn.  As your projects get more varied, you'll want different types of yarn.</p>
    <p>Here are a few yarns to start with.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Wool yarn</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Fine wool</li>
          <li>Medium wool</li>
          <li>Long wool</li>
          <li>Double wool</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Cashmere yarn</li>
      <li>Alpaca yarn</li>
      <li>Multi fiber yarn</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Stitches</h3>
    <p>There are so many types of stitches that make so many beautiful patterns.</p>
    <p>Here are a few stitches you might use as a beginner.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Knit stitch</li>
      <li>Purl stich</li>
      <li>Stockinette stitch</li>
      <li>Seed stitch</li>
      <li>Garter stitch</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Projects to start with</h3>
    <p>As I mentioned before, a lot of people start with a washcloth as their first project.  What should be your next project?</p>
    <p>These are a few project types that are great for beginners.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Scarf</li>
      <li>Wristband</li>
      <li>Headband</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
    <p>I hope you enjoy going to your local yarn shop and picking out some yarn for your first project.  Feel it and smell it to get an idea of what it would be like to knit with it.  Even the simplist projects look wonderful when knit with beautiful yarn.  If it takes a while to feel like you know what you're doing, just remember that everyone goes through that!</p>
